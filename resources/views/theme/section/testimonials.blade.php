								<h3>Lori Stutsman</h3>
								<p class="mb-3">Our team hired The Academy for Leadership and Training to do some internal team building and to help our team work better with our wide variety of client types.  Jim used fun and actionable methods to help us establish our own work styles, understand how the rest of the team fits in, and identify each of our major client’s work styles so we can build stronger relationships with them.  We had Jim fly up to Seattle, and spend an entire day with him.  Everyone found the session to be uplifting, interesting and interactive, but the most important outcome was the ability to better understand our clients and how best to present new ideas and interact with them.   It has been 9 months since our session, and we still use the principles learned in the session.  I would highly recommend TAFLAT to any business looking to develop their team members and to build stronger relationships with their clients. </p>
