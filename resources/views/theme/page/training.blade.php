						<h5>Finding Your Leadership Strengths</h5>
						<p>Research shows that effective leaders must possess a high level of self-awareness. But too many leaders are blind to their own personalities -- they simply don't know their own strengths and weaknesses. In this course, participants learn to identify their leadership strengths, increasing their self-confidence. Leaders learn to incorporate their strengths into the workplace, making them more motivated and engaged.
							</p>
						<p>The course leverages the Gallup book and online assessment.</p>

							<h5>Ethics and Personal Values</h5>
							<p>Character is composed of your personal standards of behavior including honesty, integrity, and moral strength. Integrity is congruence between what you know, say, and do.

							<p>This course is designed to improve the participant’s awareness of the impact of personal values, and to learn new techniques to get to the root cause of ethics issues. The participants examine case studies of ethical issues in corporations, and work to define the root cause(s) of the issues.</p>

							<h5>Leading by Example</h5>
