			<h5>Frequently Asked Questions About Leadership Training</h5>

			  </button>	  
			</p>
			
			
			<div class="collapse pb-3" id="faq1"> 
			  <div class="card p-3">
				Great question. According to studies, 85% of "leaders of people" are promoted into their positions with no training or coaching on how to effectively lead a team. We all know that managing others is the hardest part, and most inspirational part, of one's career. So, our clients have found that the investment in the leadership skills of their staff builds their employees' engagement levels, and maximizes the power of teams to problem solve and plan projects together! 
			  </div>

				<i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> What skills are developed a typical Leadership Program?
			  </button>	  
			</p>
			
			<div class="collapse pb-3" id="faq2"> 
			  <div class="card p-3">
				We customize all of our leadership programs for each client. At the same time, there are several themes that almost all our clients request.<br> 
				1) Leadership Attitude: When a person is promoted from an individual-contributor to a leader-of-others, s/he needs to appreciate that their behavior influences others more than it used to. As such, one element of our leadership programs is Emotional Intelligence, and how to self-manage so that you show up as your best self. <br> 
				2) Strategic Thinking: Leading a team means communicating the strategic impact of everyone's work on the bigger picture. A great leader goes beyond assigning tasks, and explains why the task is relevant to the department's success, and/or the company's success. <br> 
				3) Team Problem Solving: A leader-of-others will own many more problems. At the same time, s/he cannot do all of the work. So, a great leader will use team problem solving techniques to gain everyone's opinions on the root cause of issues, and will use the strength of the team to develop resolutions. <br> 
				4) Feedback: Giving and getting feedback may be the core of great leadership. It sounds easy. We help leaders gain their voice in terms of providing business-feedback, and we hope to inspire leaders to ask for feedback on a regular basis.

				The first step to finding the best program is thinking through your objectives for developing your leaders. Our clients tell us that they originally felt our prices were a bit high, but they found that our programs created the behavior changes in their leaders. In that way, TAFLAT's leadership programs have deep positive impacts.

				Our programs have to differentiators: <br>
				1) We customize our curriculum for our clients. Built into our cost are up-front meetings with company leaders to hear from them what they are trying to accomplish...and the business case for why. <br>
				2) Unlike large companies who use sub-contractors, TAFLAT has three senior facilitators, so you always know/meet who you are hiring. Our facilitation is more than fun and interactive, it leads to deep connections with each other and with our senior facilitators.

				There's an old joke. A CEO and a CFO are debating about whether to purchase a leadership program. The CFO says, "Well, what if we invest all this money, and some of them leave the company anyway?" To which, the CEO replies, "What if we DON'T invest in them, and they all STAY?" Studies show that a great leader is the greatest determinant for employee engagement and retaining your top talent. Companies must constantly develop their talent to reach their business objectives.
